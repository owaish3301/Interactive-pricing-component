## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

- React Context API
- Dynamic Slider Implementation

### Continued development

In future I aim to :
- Improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels and keyboard navigation for the slider.
- Experiment with animation libraries like Framer Motion for smoother transitions.
- Explore using TypeScript to add type safety to the codebase.

### Useful resources

- [React Docs - ContextAPI](https://react.dev/) - Helped me set up global state management.
